# ToDoList

* Simple Task Manager using Vanilla JS with filter, sorted list, add and remove button.
* Debounce on filter to avoid DOM updates on each letter typed
* Data persisted into Local Storage
* Data stored in the form of a set to avoid duplicates in the task list
* Tried to incorporate Module pattern, facade pattern and Singleton.
